# Data-Analysis-Developer-Survey-

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of developer survey data, focusing on various aspects of the developer landscape, their technologies, and their demographics. The analysis leverages Python's powerful data science libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

1. Dataset
* The analysis is based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023 Data.
* Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2023-developers-survey
* Files:
* survey_results_public.csv: The primary dataset containing the raw responses from survey participants. Each row represents a respondent, and columns correspond to their answers.
* survey_results_schema.csv: Provides the schema for the public dataset, detailing the full questions associated with each column name in survey_results_public.csv.

2. Project Overview
* The core of this project is to extract meaningful insights from a large developer survey dataset. Through a series of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps, this analysis explores:
* Developer Roles: Identification and categorization of developers (e.g., Full-stack, Backend, Frontend).
* Geographical Distribution: Analysis of developer presence across various countries.
* Operating System Usage: Insights into the most commonly used operating systems by developers.
* Technology Stack: Deep dive into programming languages, frameworks, and tools favored by developers.
* Employment Status & Salary: Examination of employment trends and salary distributions.
* Data Quality: Implementation of techniques for finding and removing outliers to ensure robust analysis.
* Interactive Exploration: Ability to perform custom queries (e.g., checking multiple conditions, checking for specific OS users).

3. Technologies Used
* Python: The primary programming language for the analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
* Pandas: Essential for data loading, manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
* Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations to present findings.
